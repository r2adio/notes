# DIFFERENT HASHES:

- though we both have same content in our repos, still have different commit hashes.
- while commit hashes are derived from their content changes, still some other stuff that affects the end hash:
  - the commit message
  - the author's name, email
  - date and time
  - parent (previous) commit hashes

<!-- NOTE: HASH = SHA
    - git uses cryptographic hash function, SHA-1, to genereate commit hashes
    - at times commit hashes are reffered to as "SHAs"
-->
